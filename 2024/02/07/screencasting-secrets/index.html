             <p>Screencasting is my secret weapon as a remote software engineer. I'm one of those people who just wants to go fast all the time, and you get to move a lot faster once you get good at showing people what you've made and putting them at ease about the idea of shipping it. At any job, one of the most common questions I hear is "How do you do all those GIFs and videos and screenshots and stuff?". Here's how.</p>
             <h2>Text is first</h2>
             <p>Working well with plain old text is a prerequisite for any kind of screencasting success. Deep down it's the same thing: you're trying to get information from your head into someone else's. If your written communication isn't clear, your screen recordings won't be either.</p>
             <p>Think about how you report bugs, for example. The phrase "it's broken" might mean anything from "it's crashing on startup for 100% of users" to "I don't feel like the performance is reliable enough". The phrase "the numbers are wrong" might mean something as severe as "these miscalculations will get us sued by the tax authorities" or as minor as "we're showing too many decimal places here". If your text communication style is vague, your screenshots and screen recordings will probably be vague too.</p>
             <p>The trick with the bug report example is to think about what your expectations were, contrast them with what actually happened, and write something that conveys the difference between the two as clearly as possible. It's a thought process that requires you to put yourself in the shoes of the audience and take the time to shape the message around their perspective. Half the ingredients of success when producing a video or screenshot of something is applying that same thought process in a visual way.</p>
             <h2>Screenshots</h2>
             <p>The simplest thing to share is often a screenshot. If something can be conveyed in a static image, it's almost always preferable to do so rather than deal with the extra headaches that come with video. The principles of taking good screenshots, such as tailoring the framing and sizing to suit the target platform and audience, are fundamental to good screen recordings too.</p>
             <p>You can take a screenshot of your entire desktop by pressing ⌘⇧3. That's usually the wrong option though. It's almost always better to use ⌘⇧4 and then select a region using the mouse. Another great option is to press ⌘⇧4, then space, and then click on a window to take a screenshot of it. In the following video, I'll demo all three of these, in the same order as they're written.</p>
             <figure>
              <video src="/2024/02/07/screenshot.mp4" controls></video>
              <figcaption>I'm using <a href="https://appahead.studio/apps/keystroke-pro/">Keystroke Pro</a> in the video above to visualise the key presses. It's a tool I recommend very highly. It comes in especially handy if you need to screencast a series of keyboard interactions like this one.</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>Even the humble screenshot has some nuances that are worth thinking about. Where will you upload your screenshot and how much space is available for it there? What size is optimal to help your audience understand your point as easily as possible? If there are multiple windows involved, is there some way you can rearrange them to structure the information in the screenshot more clearly?</p>
             <p>If you're posting something on a GitHub issue or pull request, for example, you'll have about 800px of width to play with. Could it work for you to resize the window in preparation for your screenshot so that it doesn't appear too zoomed out and squished there? For <a href="https://github.com/zetkin/app.zetkin.org/pull/1631">before/after screenshots</a>, it fits particularly well if both screenshots are a common mobile resolution.</p>
             <h2>Annotated screenshots</h2>
             <p>Sometimes your screenshots need a little extra something. Like occasionally it's just easier to <a href="https://github.com/zetkin/app.zetkin.org/pull/1641">visually highlight some detail</a> in there with an annotation. For this, I use Skitch.</p>
             <p>Awkwardly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/18/evernote-acquires-image-sharing-site-skitch/">Evernote acquired Skitch back in 2011</a>, and in recent years it's basically become abandonware. But for now at least, you can still do <code>brew install --cask skitch</code>, and it'll run. In theory you can do ⌘⇧5 to take screenshots directly into Skitch, but in practice that's been broken for years, so I take them with the macOS native ⌘⇧4 and then drag &#x26; drop them into Skitch like this.</p>
             <figure>
              <video src="/2024/02/07/skitch.mp4" controls></video>
              <figcaption>I'm using the ⌘-Space keyboard shortcut here to open Skitch using <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/search-with-spotlight-mchlp1008/mac">Spotlight</a>.</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>It's a shame Skitch is slowly dying. I've been recommending it to colleagues since like 2015, and still occasionally see someone I introduced it to share something annotated with it on social media. Will be sad when that connection is finally broken.</p>
             <h2>Animated GIF screen recordings</h2>
             <p>You can get a lot done with screen recordings in animated GIF format. They're incredibly versatile, because almost all chat &#x26; collaboration platforms allow you to post GIFs. <a href="https://gifox.app/">Gifox</a> is the best app for this, and well worth the cost.</p>
             <p>Fear of failure holds people back from trying this. People worry it'll require advanced technical skills. It doesn't. Here's a video of the full end-to-end recording and editing workflow to produce one GIF. It takes less than a minute.</p>
             <figure>
              <video src="/2024/02/07/gifox.mp4" controls></video>
              <figcaption>This is what it looks like to create a screencast GIF using Gifox. The app I'm using as an example to record is <a href="https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop">Boop</a>.</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>Gifox gives you lots of control over how to export your GIF. The one I use most often is the resizing option, which is why I made sure to demo it in the video above. Big animated GIFs take so long to load that nobody will watch your video, and scaling down is an easy way to avoid this. Most of the time you don't really need a full 100% original size GIF either.</p>
             <p>The secret to doing these things right is to keep them short. Animated GIFs almost never have playback controls, so your audience has no way to rewind or pause your video. And longer GIFs will exceed most platforms' upload file size limits anyway.</p>
             <p>Another thing to bear in mind is that GIFs loop. Sometimes it's necessary for the clarity of the video that the end point should be very distinctive. Other times it's super nice to make the loop completely seamless. It's a case-by-case thing and you get a feel for it after a while.</p>
             <h2>Video screen recordings</h2>
             <p>When something won't fit within the limitations of the GIF format, I'll fire up QuickTime and do a screen recording instead. This has a similar workflow to Gifox. You select an area to record, do your demo, end the recording with the little taskbar stop button, and then press ⌘T to trim the clip.</p>
             <figure>
              <video src="/2024/02/07/quicktime.mp4" controls></video>
              <figcaption>I made all the other videos for this post using this workflow. <em>This</em> one took some fucking doing though.</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>It's worth checking the options before hitting <code>Record</code>. Pay particular attention to the microphone setting. Most of the time you'll want to set this to <code>None</code>. Nobody needs to hear the background hum of your dishwasher while you demo your new feature or whatever you're recording.</p>
             <p>QuickTime will output a fairly chunky <code>.mov</code> file at the end of this. I tend to use <code>ffmpeg</code> to scale these down and convert them to <code>.mp4</code>. This will often cut the file size from tens or hundreds of megabytes down into the 1MB-ish range.</p>
             <pre class="">ffmpeg -i words.mov -vf "scale=iw/2:ih/2" words.mp4
</pre>
             <h2>Video screen recordings with system audio</h2>
             <p>When I need to include system audio in a screen recording, I reach for Rogue Amoeba's excellent <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/">Loopback</a> app. Nine times out of ten, if I'm doing this it's because I want someone to hear what a screen reader interaction with their UI sounds like. For this, I have a premade VoiceOver virtual device configured in Loopback. It just needs switching on, and then it's available as a microphone in QuickTime's recording options.</p>
             <figure>
              <video src="/2024/02/07/loopback.mp4" controls></video>
              <figcaption>This one's complex enough that I figured it's helpful to make <a href="/2024/02/07/voiceover.mp4" target="_blank">the resulting screen recording</a> available so that you can see for yourself that the screen reader announcement audio has been captured in the recording.</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>For screen reader announcements in particular, it's often overkill to go to these lengths. I've mainly found it useful when working in partnership with blind people to evaluate and improve complex ARIA implementations. For demonstrating screen reader announcement changes to sighted colleagues I've often found it sufficient to show them <a href="https://github.com/zetkin/app.zetkin.org/pull/1724">animated GIFs with VoiceOver's visual announcement visible in the viewport</a>.</p>
             <h2>Give it a try</h2>
             <p>You don't need to wait for your employer to approve budget for some expensive 3rd party SaaS screencasting platform like Loom. Fancypants extras – like enabling you to overlay a video of yourself talking on your screencasts – might sound like gamechangers. But I think most of the outcome in these techniques depends on whether or not you personally engage with communication as a craft in itself, and you don't necessarily need to add another subscription to your monthly bills if you're willing to learn your way around a handful of standalone tools.</p>
             <p>Sighted people bloody <em>love</em> a visual demo, and catering to that preference is an underutilised way to speed up feedback loops and build trust and consensus around shipping things sooner. If you take away nothing else from this, I hope you install Gifox today!</p>
